## Documentation Branches
A `docs` branch is focused on writing and improving the documentation for GEOS.
The use of the `docs` branch name root applies to both sphinx documentation
and doxygen documentation.
The `docs` branch follows the same naming conventions as described in the :ref:`Feature_Branches`
section.
The html produced by a documentation branch should be proofread using sphinx/doxygen
prior to merging into `develop`.


# Keeping Your Branch Current
Over the course of a long development effort in a single `feature` branch, a
developer may need to either merge `develop` into their `feature` branch, or rebase
their `feature` branch on `develop`.
We do not have a mandate on how you keep your branch current, but we do have
guidelines on the branch history when merging your branch into `develop`.
Typically, merging `develop` into your branch is the easiest approach, but will
lead to a complex relationship with `develop` with multiple interactions... which
can lead to a confusing history.
Conversely, rebasing your branch onto `develop` is more difficult, but will lead
to a linear history within the branch.
For a complex history, we will perform a squash merge into `develop`, thereby
the work from the branch will appear as a single commit in `develop`.
For clean branch histories where the individual commits are meaningful and should
be preserved, we have the option to perform a merge commit in with the PR is merged
into `develop`, with the addition of a merge commit, thus maintaining the commit history.


# Branching off of a Branch
During the development processes, sometimes it is appropriate to create a branch
off of a branch.
For instance, if there is a large collaborative development effort on the branch
`feature/theMatrix`, and a developer would like to add a self-contained and easily
reviewable contribution to that effort, he/she should create a branch as follows:

``console
  git checkout feature/theMatrix
  git checkout -b feature/smith/dodgeBullets
  git push -u origin feature/smith/dodgeBullets

If `feature/smith/dodgeBullets` is intended to be merged into `feature/theMatrix`,
and the commit history of `feature/theMatrix` is not changed via `git rebase`, then
the process of merging the changes back into `feature/theMatrix` is fairly standard.

However, if `feature/theMatrix` is merged into `develop` via a `squash merge`,
and then `smith` would like to merge `feature/smith/dodgeBullets` into `develop`,
there is a substantial problem due to the diverged history of the branches.
Specifically, `feature/smith/dodgeBullets` branched off a commit in `feature/theMatrix`
that does not exist in `develop` (because it was squash-merged).
For simplicity, let us assume that the commit hash that `feature/smith/dodgeBullets`
originated from is `CC`, and that there were commits `CA, CB, CC, CD` in `feature/theMatrix`.
When `feature/theMatrix` was squash-merged, all of the changes appear in `develop` as commit `G`.
To further complicate the situation, perhaps a complex PR was merged after `G`, resulting
in `E` on develop.
The situation is illustrated by:

``console
   A----B----C----D----E----F----G----E (develop)
              \                 /
               CA---CB---CC---CD        (feature/theMatrix)
                          \
                          CCA--CCB--CCC (feature/smith/dodgeBullets)

In order to successfully merge `feature/smith/dodgeBullets` into `develop`, all
commits present in `feature/smith/dodgeBullets` after `CC` must be included, while discarding
`CA, CB`, which exist in `feature/smith/dodgeBullets` as part of its history, but not
in `develop`.

One "solution" is to perform a `git rebase --onto` of `feature/smith/dodgeBullets` onto
`develop`.
Specifically, we would like to rebase `CCA, CCB, CCC` onto `G`, and proceed with our
development of `feature/smith/dodgeBullets`.
This would look like:

``console
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout feature/smith/dodgeBullets
   git rebase -onto G CC

As should be apparent, we have specified the starting point as `G`, and the point
at which we replay the commits in `feature/smith/dodgeBullets` as all commits
AFTER `CC`.
The result is:

``console
   A----B----C----D----E----F----G----E (develop)
                                  \
                                 CCA'--CCB'--CCC' (feature/smith/dodgeBullets)

Now you may proceed with standard methods for keeping `feature/smith/dodgeBullets`
current with `develop`.

.. _Submitting_a_Pull_Request:

# Submitting a Pull Request
Once you have created your branch and pushed changes to Github, you can create a
`Pull Request ](https://github.com/GEOS-DEV/GEOS/pulls) on Github.
The PR creates a central place to review and discuss the ongoing work on the branch.
Creating a pull request early in the development process is preferred as it allows
for developers to collaborate on the branch more readily.


   work is ongoing and the PR is not ready for testing, review, and merge consideration.

When you create the initial draft PR, please ensure that you apply appropriate labels.
Applying labels allows other developers to more quickly filter the live PRs and access
those that are relevant to them. Always add the [new` label upon PR creation, as well
as to the appropriate `type`, `priority`, and  `effort` labels. In addition, please
also add any appropriate `flags`.



   the PR to ensure they are appropriately resolved once the PR is merged.
   In order to `link` the issue to the PR for automatic resolution, you must use
   one of the keywords followed by the issue number (e.g. resolves #1020) in either
   the main description of the PR, or a commit message.
   Entries in PR comments that are not the main description or a commit message
   will be ignored, and the issue will not be automatically closed.
   A complete list of keywords are:

   - close
   - closes
   - closed
   - fix
   - fixes
   - fixed
   - resolve
   - resolves
   - resolved

   For more details, see the `Github Documentation ](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).

Once you are satisfied with your work on the branch, you may promote the PR out of
draft status, which will allow our integrated testing suite to execute on the PR branch
to ensure all tests are passing prior to merging.


   The allowed prefixes are:

   - feat: A new feature
   - fix: A bug fix,
   - docs: Documentation only changes,
   - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc),
   - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature,
   - perf: A code change that improves performance,
   - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests,
   - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: cmake),
   - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: github),
   - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files,
   - revert: Reverts a previous commit,

Once the tests are passing -- or in some cases immediately -- add the `flag: ready for review`
label to the PR, and be sure to tag any relevant developers to review the PR. The PR
*must* be approved by reviewers in order to be merged.

Note that whenever a pull request is merged into `develop`, commits are either
`squashed`, or preserved depending on the cleanliness of the history.


# Keeping Submodules Current
Whenever you switch between branches locally, pull changes from `origin` and/or
`merge` from the relevant branches, it is important to update the submodules to
move the `head` to the proper `commit`.

```console
  git submodule update --recursive

You may also wish to modify your `git pull` behavior to update your submodules
recursively for you in one command, though you forfeit some control granularity
to do so. The method for accomplishing this varies between git versions, but
as of git 2.15 you should be able to globally configure git to accomplish this via:

``console
   git config --global submodule.recurse true

In some cases, code changes will require to rebaseline the `Integrated Tests`.
If that is the case, you will need to modify the `integrated tests submodule`.
Instructions on how to modify a submodule are presented in the following section.

# Working on the Submodules
Sometimes it may be necessary to modify one of the submodules. In order to do so,
you need to create a pull request on the submodule repository. The following steps
can be followed in order to do so.

Move to the folder of the `submodule` that you intend to modify.

``console
  cd submodule-folder

Currently the `submodule` is in detached head mode, so you first need to move
to the main branch (either `develop` or `master`) on the
submodule repository, pull the latest changes, and then create a new branch.

```console
  git checkout <main-branch>
  git pull
  git checkout -b <branch-name>

You can perform some work on this branch, `add` and `commit` the changes and then push
the newly created branch to the `submodule repository` on which you can eventually
create a pull request using the same process discussed above in :ref:`Submitting_a_Pull_Request`.

```console
  git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>


# Resolving Submodule Changes in Primary Branch PRs
When you conduct work on a submodule during work on a primary GEOS
branch with an open PR, the merging procedure requires that the submodule referenced
by the GEOS PR branch be consistent with the submodule in the main branch of the project.
This is checked and enforced via our CI.

Thus, in order to merge a PR that includes modifications to submodules, the various PRs for
each repository should be staged and finalized, to the point they are all ready to be merged,
with higher-level PRs in the merge hierarchy having the correct submodule references for the
current main branch for their repository.

Starting from the bottom of the submodule hierarchy, the PRs are resolved, after which the
higher-level PRs with reference to a resolved PR must update their submodule references
to point to the new main branch of the submodule with the just-resolved PR merged.
After any required automated tests pass, the higher-level PRs can then be merged.

The name of the main branch of each submodule is presented in the table below.

================    ================
Submodule           Main branch
================    ================
blt                 develop
LvArray             develop
integratedTests     develop
hdf5_interface      master
PVTPackage          master
================    ================
